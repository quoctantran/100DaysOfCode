## Some important indicators
### TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)
I use 12, 50, 200 as short, medium and long length.
Principle: If the shorter EMA crosses below the longer term EMA, it's a sell signal as it indicates the trend is shifting down (short term price goes down faster). We can call it a *Death Cross*.
Generally, the significance of a death cross is related to recent changes in trading volume. The higher the trading volume, the more meaningful the death cross is said to be.
### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
It calculates the difference between 26-day and 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA is plotted in the middle, acting as a trigger for buy and sell. The MACD generates a bullish signal when it is above 9-day line, and vice versa. The histogram grows larger as the speed of the price movement accelerates. 
### Pivot points
They are used to identify major daily support or resistance levels. Check [here](https://www.barchart.com/forex/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/cheat-sheet) for a BTCUSD example.
### ATR (Average True Range)
ATR is not a directional indicator, such as MACD or RSI. Instead, ATR is a unique volatility indicator that reflects the degree of interest or disinterest in a move. Strong moves, in either direction, are often accompanied by large ranges. ATR can be used to validate the enthusiasm behind a move or breakout. A bullish reversal with an increase in ATR would show strong buying pressure and reinforce the reversal. A bearish support break with an increase in ATR would show strong selling pressure and reinforce the support break.
### EFI (Elder's Force Index)
EFI measures the power behind a price movement using price and volume. The indicator can also be used to identify potential reversals and price corrections. The EFI is an oscillator that fluctuates between positive and negative values, above and below a Zero Line. Alexander Elder, the indicator's creator, believed that there are three components to a security's price movement. Those three components are; *direction, extent and volume*. All three of these components are combined by the EFI to generate the oscillator. 
### Ichimoku cloud
*Bullish Signals:*
Price moves above Cloud (trend)
Cloud turns from red to green (ebb-flow within trend)
Price Moves above the Base Line (momentum)
Conversion Line moves above Base Line (momentum)
*Bearish Signals:*
Price moves below Cloud (trend)
Cloud turns from green to red (ebb-flow within trend)
Price Moves below Base Line (momentum)
Conversion Line moves below Base Line (momentum)
### Stochastics and RSI (Relative Strength Index)
Oscillators: to determine the strength of a trend or to predict tops and bottoms because of overbought and oversold conditions, signal to enter or exit. So it's good for short term.
### Bollinger band: Support & resistance

## Indicators used at the same time.
MACD, stochastics and RSI may be part of the same "family". So they may be redundant. We can pick one from each group below.
+ Oscillators: RSI, Stochastics, Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and MACD.
+ Volume: Aside from basic Volume, others combine volume with price data to determine how strong a price trend is. Chaikin Money Flow, On Balance Volume and Money Flow.
+ Overlays: With overlays we may choose to use more than one. Popular overlays include Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, Parabolic SAR, Moving Averages, Pivot Points and Fibonacci Extensions and Retracements.
+ Breadth Indicators: concerns trader sentiment or what the broader market is doing. These are mostly stock market related, and include Trin, Ticks, Tiki and the Advance-Decline Line.

So,
RSI could be used to help isolate the trend and entry points. 
A moving average, ATR Stops (Chandelier Exits) or Moving Average Envelopes could then be applied to the chart (overlays) to aid in exits. For example, one of these could be used as a trailing stock loss on trending trades. If the trend is up, look to exit if the price falls below the line (which will be below the price as the price rises).


## Similar patterns
+ The purpose is to choose the right moment for a short-term entry :+1:
+ First I need to consult GitHub's [formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) to make a neat notebook.

Now here we go. First we need to look at the same pattern in 2 different moments in the chart below.
